0. take in a word as a parameter and iterate through it
1. find specific letters 
2. enclose them in {}
3. double their value
4. find other specific letters
5. enclose them in []
6. triple their value
```
Double or Triple Word

1. take in a word as a parameter
2. enclose it in {}
3. double its value
 OR
2. enclose it in []
3. triple its value
